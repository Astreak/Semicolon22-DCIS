# Ductal Carcinoma Detection in Breast Cancer Cells

This repository contains code and resources for detecting Ductal Carcinoma in breast cancer cells using deep learning techniques.

## Overview

Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths among women worldwide. Ductal Carcinoma, a common type of breast cancer, arises in the ducts that carry milk to the nipple. Early and accurate detection of this cancer type is crucial for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes.

This project focuses on the development of a deep learning model using PyTorch to automatically detect and classify Ductal Carcinoma in breast tissue images.

## Technologies Used

- **PyTorch**: Used to build and train the deep learning model for image classification.
- **Python**: Programming language used for implementing the algorithms and model.
- **Pandas**: Utilized for data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Seaborn**: Employed for data visualization and result analysis.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/ductal-carcinoma-detection.git
